	<description>Creates a crystal ball that pawns can use to scry into the future to prepare for future incidents

		To Use: 
		1. Create a Crystal Ball Table from the Production tab. The ball is made out of Jade, so you will need that resource.
		2. Assign a colonist to do the "Scry" work. This work is influenced by Intellectual and their Psychic Sensitivity
		3. Colonists will use the crystal ball to peer into the future and see what events lie in store

		Some Technical Details:
		- This mod is only able to know what events will happen in the future because it essentially delays them by a random interval
		- This means it might have compatibility issues with other mods that mess with how incidents are triggered
		- Because the delays are random by default (can configure it differently), it means you could have 2 bad things happen on the same day (which seems like a good balance to me since you can know the 2 things are happening ahead of time)
		- It does not affect Storytellers. The mod will tell the Storyteller it's on its normal schedule, so it will behave normally.
		- There are mod settings to adjust the incident delays as well as how frequently you can use the crystal ball
